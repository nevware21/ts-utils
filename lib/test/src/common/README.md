# Common Universal Tests

This folder contains tests that are supported in every environment. These tests are designed to be environment-agnostic and should run consistently across all platforms and configurations.

## Overview

The tests in this directory have been verified to work in:
- Development environments
- Staging environments
- Production environments
- All supported operating systems
- All supported browsers (where applicable)

## Running Tests

These tests can be run using the standard test runner without any special configurations or environment-specific setup.

## Contributing

When adding new tests to this folder, ensure they maintain environment independence and do not rely on specific configurations that may not be available in all environments.
