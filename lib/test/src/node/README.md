This directory contains tests that are specifically designed to run in a Node.js environment. These tests focus on Node-specific APIs, behaviors, and environment characteristics that aren't applicable to browser or other JavaScript runtimes.

## What's Tested Here

- Node.js specific APIs (fs, path, child_process, etc.)
- Environment variables and process information
- Node.js module system specifics
- Platform-specific behaviors when running on Node.js

## Running Tests

These tests should be executed in a Node.js environment and may not work correctly in browsers or other JavaScript runtimes.
