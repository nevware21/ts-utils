# Worker Environment Tests

This directory contains tests specifically designed for the worker environment. These tests validate the functionality of code running in worker contexts, such as web workers, service workers, or other background processing environments.

## Purpose

The test suite in this folder verifies that our application components function correctly when executed in a worker environment, which has different constraints and capabilities compared to the main thread environment.

## Running Tests

Tests in this folder may require special configuration to properly simulate a worker environment. Please refer to the testing documentation for specific setup instructions.

## Notes

- Some tests may mock worker-specific APIs
- Worker environment tests may validate communication patterns, message passing, and concurrency aspects
- These tests complement the main test suite by ensuring cross-environment compatibility
