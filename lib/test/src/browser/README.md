# Browser Tests

This directory contains tests that are specifically designed to run in a browser environment. These tests validate functionality that depends on browser-specific APIs, DOM interaction, and client-side behavior that cannot be properly tested in a Node.js environment.

## Environment Requirements

- These tests should be run in actual browsers or browser-like environments
- Browser testing tools like Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium may be used to automate these tests
- Browser-specific features such as DOM manipulation, local storage, cookies, and browser events are tested here

## Running Tests

Make sure to set up the appropriate browser testing infrastructure before executing these tests.
