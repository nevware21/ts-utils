### Issue: Pinning @sinonjs/samsam to Previous Version

We are experiencing a CI failure due to a syntax error introduced in the latest version of @sinonjs/samsam. This can be referenced in the CI run [here](https://github.com/nevware21/ts-utils/actions/runs/17055984352/job/48502594498?pr=448).

The error message encountered is: 
`Error parsing code: Unexpected token`

As a workaround, we need to pin @sinonjs/samsam to the last working version until this issue is resolved.
